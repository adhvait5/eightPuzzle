8-Puzzle Solver (Uniform Cost Search & A*)

This project implements a solver for the classic 8-puzzle problem using graph search techniques, including Uniform Cost Search and A* with two different heuristics. The program allows users to select predefined puzzle configurations or input their own custom puzzle and observe the search process step by step.
